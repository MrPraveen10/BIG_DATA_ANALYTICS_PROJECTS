    ">This process is for dividing a dataset, referred to as `final_basetable`, into `training`, `testing`, and `validation` subsets. Initially, the dataset is split into train and test sets with `70%` of the data allocated to training and `30%` to testing, using a `train_test_split` function with a random_state of `42` for reproducibility. Subsequently, the training set is further divided, allocating `80%` of its data to a new training set and `20%` to a validation set, again using the same train_test_split function and random_state. After these splits, the indices of each DataFrame—train, test, and validation—are reset to ensure they are clean and sequential from zero without gaps. "

    "A dictionary named param_dist is created, defining a range of values for various hyperparameters of the SVD algorithm, including **n_factors** (number of factors), **n_epochs** (number of iterations over the training data), **lr_all** (learning rate for all parameters), **reg_all** (regularization term for all parameters), and settings like `random_state`, `biased`, and `verbose`. An instance of the SVD class is defined, and RandomizedSearchCV is set up to perform a grid search over the defined parameter space. The search is conducted with` 5 iteration`s and` 3-fold cross-validatio`n, targeting the root mean square error (RMSE) as the evaluation metric. The refit=True parameter ensures that once the best hyperparameters are found, the model is refit on the entire training set using those parameters: The best-fit model from the grid search is then used to make predictions on both validation (val_data) and test (test_data) datasets. The RMSE for each dataset is calculated to assess the accuracy of the model."
