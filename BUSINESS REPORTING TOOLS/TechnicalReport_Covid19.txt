UNRAVELING THE PANDEMIC: A COVID - 19 DATA CHRONICLE.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Explain the logic behind your analysis:

1.Covid Data for 2020-2022
Vaccination
The progression of vaccinations through time is depicted in a line graph to show the association between cumulative verified COVID-19 cases and mortality.
The data points to a crucial turning point when immunizations start to affect the pandemic's course. 
The need for vaccination campaigns is highlighted by the initial strong upward slope of cases and deaths that coincides with low immunization rates. 
The effectiveness of vaccination in reducing the effects of the virus is seen by the apparent slowing in case and mortality curves as vaccination rates rise. 
This analysis emphasizes how crucial vaccination campaigns are to containing the pandemic.
Restictions
An important finding can be drawn from examining the line graph showing gathering bans and public awareness programs in relation to the total number of verified COVID-19 cases.
There is a discernible decrease in the number of confirmed cases when gathering limits are tightened and public awareness initiatives are stepped up. 
This association shows that successful public education campaigns and the implementation and reinforcement of social distance-building measures are crucial to limiting the spread of the virus.
These results stress the importance of public health initiatives in reducing the pandemic's effects and the necessity of ongoing awareness-raising and education campaigns.
New cases world map
The combination of a map and an area chart to display new confirmed and death cases by country provides a comprehensive view of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The map visually depicts the geographic distribution of cases, allowing quick identification of hotspots. 
Meanwhile, the area chart complements the map by revealing temporal trends, showing the ebb and flow of new cases and deaths.
This dynamic duo of visualizations empowers viewers to understand not only where outbreaks are occurring but also how the situation has evolved over time, aiding in strategic decision-making and resource allocation.

2.Covid-19 Dashboard:
	-Covid-19 Summary Country code Dashboard:
	-To calculate cumulative confirmed ,cumulative Deceased, Cumulative Recovered Cases.	
	-Mapping of Country code to show the Cumulative data of covid-19 
	- GDP and Gender Covid-19 Dashboard:
	-To show the  gender wise distrubtion of Covid-19 cases with respect country
	- Impact of Covid-19 on GDP of Indiviual Country 
---------------------*-------------------------------*----------------------*---------------------------------*-------------------------------*--------------------------------*-----------------------------*-------------------------
3.Locations of Average Smoking and Deceased Hotspots Dashboard:
 	We can check for corrilations and high risk zones, and we can identify any spatial patterns or clusters, of each country 
 	We can check any trend in times, to identify periods with spikes in smoking and if at the same time there are spikes in number of Deceased.
 	We can cross check the highest cumulative deceased cases and recovered with the increase or decrease in smoking accross regions.
  Population life Exceptancy vs Deceased Dashboard:
	China then India, has the higherst population with a avg life-expectancy being 76 & 69. BUt the Number of New deceased is drastically different from approx 27k to 528k in India. 
	While matching with the time series, we can find and conculte that COVID-19 cases arrises by bursts of time periods or there is some Infomation inconsistancies with China's Data.
	Additionally the differece in Life Expectancy, also may indicate the haelth and well being of peopme in CHina being better

On the line graph Titled Population Life Expectancy vs Deaseased, 
average life expectancy and the number of new COVID-19 deaths, 
an inverse correlation can be obsersved. 
This could be due to 
1) Greater number of pre-existing health conditions
2) Vulnerable population 
3) Discrepancies in testing and reporting practices.

-Overarching storyline:

The storyboards are interconnected and provide a comprehensive view of different aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Here's how each story is linked to the others:
Mapping COVID-19: 
This storyboard sets the foundation by visualizing the spread of COVID-19 through maps and line graphs.
It highlights the spike in cases from November 2021, which becomes a reference point for analyzing other stories.

Tracking the Journey: 
This storyboard builds upon the previous one by tracking the cumulative cases, deaths, and vaccinations over time.
It shows the intersection point where cumulative vaccinations surpass cumulative cases, indicating progress in vaccination efforts.

Balancing Public Information and Gathering Restrictions: 
This storyboard explores the relationship between public information campaigns, gathering restrictions, and cumulative infections. 
It reveals how both campaigns and restrictions increase but later drop, suggesting a potential impact on the spread of the virus.

Regional Variations in Smoking Rates and COVID-19 Deaths: 
This storyboard introduces the concept of regional variations in smoking rates and COVID-19 deaths. 
By identifying hotspots and examining spatial patterns, it provides insights into potential correlations between smoking rates and COVID-19 mortality.

GDP and Gender (COVID-19) Dashboard: 
This storyboard focuses on the economic impact of COVID-19 (GDP) and the gender distribution of COVID-19 cases. 
It aims to analyze the correlation between GDP impact and cumulative cases, deaths, and recoveries, as well as the relationship between out-of-pocket health expenditure and GDP impact.

World Map of Smoking and Deceased Hotspots: 
This storyboard expands on the regional variations in smoking rates and COVID-19 deaths by visualizing smoking and deceased hotspots on a world map. 
It allows for the identification of spatial patterns and clusters, potentially revealing correlations between smoking rates and COVID-19 mortality.

Higher Number of Deceased With Higher Population: 
This storyboard focuses on the relationship between population, life expectancy, and the spread of COVID-19, specifically in China and India. 
It highlights the differences in population, average life expectancy, and the number of new deceased cases between the two countries, indicating possible variations in health and well-being.


 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Conclusion:
In Conclusion, we start from the world map showing the biggest data of New confirmed and new deceased, then we analysis the tracks the different chosen indicators take cumulative vaccinations, deaths, cases, smoking. 
Using multiple line graphs of the government measures to reduce the pandemic. Next, we analysed the cumulative data instead of the new confirmed and new deceased. 
By specifically looking at the gender and the economic impact of the GDP per country name. In a more nuanced measure, we check the smoking on the co morbidity with the underlying life expectancy. 
Lastly, we do a cost benefit analysis of the out-of-pocket expenditure and the mortality rate.
